# Coding Assignment

This repository contains solutions for two coding problems: "Water Tank Problem" and "Max Profit".

## Water Tank Problem

A web-based visualization of the classic water tank problem (Trapping Rain Water).

### Description
The application calculates the amount of water trapped between blocks of varying heights. It provides a visual representation of the blocks and the trapped water using SVG.

### How to Run
1. Navigate to the `Water tank problem` directory.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Enter a comma-separated list of non-negative integers (e.g., `0,4,0,0,0,6,0,6,4,0`) in the input field.
4. Click "Render" or press Enter to see the visualization and total water units.

## Max Profit

A Python solution for optimizing building construction to maximize profit within a given time constraint.

### Description
The script calculates the optimal mix of building types (Theatre, Pub, Commercial Park) to construct within a specified total time to maximize earnings.

**Building Types:**
- **Theatre (T):** Takes 5 units of time, earns $1500/unit.
- **Pub (P):** Takes 4 units of time, earns $1000/unit.
- **Commercial Park (C):** Takes 10 units of time, earns $2000/unit.

### How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Navigate to the `max profit` directory.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python max_profit.py
   ```
4. The script runs with predefined test inputs (7, 8, 13) and prints the maximum earnings and solution configurations.
